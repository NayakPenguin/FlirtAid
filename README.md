# FlirtAid
Dating app with inclusive gender choices, chat and real-time notifications built with Node (Express), React, Socket.io &amp; Material-UI

## What is FlirtAid?
We knew that we wanted to build a dating app, but had to figure out what was missing in the dating market. What were the burning issues that dissuade people from signing up to dating apps? Hence, to dig deeper, we did a survey in college which saw 303 participants. Here are the results of the survey:

<br/> <br/>
There were 3 major problems which people faced when it came to dating apps: <br/>
• Females received a number of creepy & lewd messages <br/>
• Males felt that they didn’t have good enough pictures to add to their profiles <br/>
• Fake profiles were a problem that plagued both genders equally <br/>
<br/>
We set out to solve all these issues and build a dating app which every student on campus would want to use. FlirtAid - JU’s very own love guru: <br/>
• Precise signal system embedded in the chat to filter out creepy messages. <br/>
• Match percentage to predict if they are the one for you. <br/>
• Face matching AI to ensure that there are no fake profiles to break your heart mercilessly. <br/>
